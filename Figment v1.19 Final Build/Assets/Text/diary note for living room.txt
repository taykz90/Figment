10th September 1999
Sally has been switching the channels on TV 
whenever a clown appears. I don't want to make 
a big fuss out of it. Obviously it's still
bothering her. We all need to give her time to 
recover. It's plain to see that the events of 1997
is still hovering over her. An event like that
would be hard for any little girl to handle. 
I hope she can overcome her fear sooner or later.
