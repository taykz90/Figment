Poor Sally.. Every time she enters the kitchen,
I always notice that she will avoid the stove,
or anywhere that may have the slightest hint of fire.
She might still be traumatized from that event - a year back.
Sally always holds the frying pan that Dad bought 
for her whenever she feels scared.
Somehow she feels more secure with it in hand. 
What a strange little sister I have.
Hopefully, she isn't as devastated as before by that event.
It's better if I don't remind her about it.
