23rd September 1997
Chaos. Everything left in ruins. All the kids were 
running away in horror from being consumed by the %^!#$* . 
How could something that had started out soo fun have 
turned into this? The events of today have been scorched 
in my memory. Just imagine how much worse it was for Sally.. 
How could my innocent little sister be put through something 
like this? It's going to scar her for the rest of her life.
